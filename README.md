# Hosts
Hosts is a full CRUD Python flask framework application that allows "hosts" to create a rental and specify unique things that matter to renters such as pay period, payment types accepted and how close in proximity they are to the property, should any needs arise. Hosts is for both short and long-term rentals. Hosts must be logged in to post, edit, or delete a rental, but others may freely browse the rentals without any need of logging in.

Utilizes MVC file structure.

Built in VS Code.
